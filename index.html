 <h1>Nick and Nates Blogging Site</h1> 
 <p class="hey">Hey Nick, I got this to publish and it's completely raw so we will need to put in every bit of code.
    WE gonna build this from the groung up. I was thinking maybe just making a social site how we want to.
    than we could keep going, move on, or use it to show what we can do for other things like jobs.</p>
